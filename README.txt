GrafIt - Simple, Inline Sparkline Graphs/Charts
===============================================================
A plugin for ExpressionEngine to display super small, inline sparkline graphs/charts from CSV style data

{exp:grafit gap="0.25" height="16" id="graph"}0,8,5,6,8,14,12,9,14,35,36,39,29,46,32,6,35,23{/exp:grafit}
Will output the graph as an image the user can save, using PHP

{exp:grafit width="72" height="24" id="chart" output="js"}0,8,5,6,8,14,12,9,14,35,36,39,29,46,32,6,35,23{/exp:grafit}
Will output the graph as a canvas element the user cannot save, using JavaScript

Parameters:
bg: The background color of the graph, it will show transparent but when saved it will show; default is #FFFFFF
color: The color of the bar/line; default is #F92672
gap: The space between bars, in decimal percentage; default is 0.25
width: a little tricky, on the bar it is the space of one bar AND gap, on a line graph is it the entire width of the chart; default is 4px
height: the height of the graph in pixels; default is 16px
output: the type of chart, either don't use it or 'js'; default is blank
